# UVA-Orientation
## Welcome to Katie Dunning's UVA Experience!
ðŸ‘‹ It's nice to meet everyone.  Please feel free to follow my journey on this page.\
This is my first real GitHub experience, so making this README is an interesting experiment.\
I am within the next week about to embark on my first semester of five in UVAs Masters in Data Science program.
